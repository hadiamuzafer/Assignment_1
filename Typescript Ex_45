/*Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in an Object. The
function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then
accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the
required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an
optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information
was stored correctly.*/
