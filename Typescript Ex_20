//Q20
Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could list mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write
a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries: Array<string>=["Pakistan", "China", "Japan", "USA"

]
for(let i of countries){
    console.log(i)
}
